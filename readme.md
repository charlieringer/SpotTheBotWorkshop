# Spot the Bot
## About
This repository supports the Spot the Bot Workshop at the 2018 IGGI Conference. It contains some data, in the form of game logs from humans and AIs playing video games as well as a selection of models for classifing these logs as human or AI as well as some clustering algorithms to explore the shape of the data.
